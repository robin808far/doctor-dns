"""Google's own names leave the exit over IPv6, where the exit has it.

Google refused Gemini, AI Studio, NotebookLM and Labs to a live exit's IPv4
address - 403 - and served the same machine the real pages over IPv6. The
exit's nginx only ever connected out over IPv4, so a customer could reach
everything but Gemini. The fix sends Google's names through a loopback hop
whose resolver asks for AAAA records only; everything else is unchanged.

What has to hold: the block is there when the exit can use it, gone when it
cannot - and gone means the file behaves exactly as it did before, blackholes
included - and the installer decides which on a real IPv6 connection to
Google and an nginx new enough to have `ipv4=off`.
