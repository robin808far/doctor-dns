"""smartdns-menu: every command in one place, and each one it runs is real.

Driven the way a person drives it - numbers and answers on stdin - against
stand-ins for every tool, which write down what they were asked to do. Then
held to the installer, so it never offers a command that is not installed, and
to the README, so a command documented there is never missing from it.
