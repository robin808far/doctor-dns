"""Opt-in groups: visible in the panel, routed by nobody until ticked.

Epic's game backend is the first of them. Routing it breaks Fortnite
matchmaking, so it belongs in the catalogue where an operator can see it and
decide - but a group that arrives already switched on has decided for them, in
the direction that breaks something.

Two things have to hold and neither is obvious. The default template means
"everything, now and later", so it has to be taught this one exception. And
epic-pin writes rules naming those exact hosts, which outrank any rule that
routes the parent domain - so a template that ticks the group has to have
those pins left out of it, or the tick does nothing at all.
