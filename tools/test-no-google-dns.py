"""The relay does not ask Google.

8.8.8.8 passes the asker's subnet on (ECS). A service that refuses Iran in its
DNS then sees the relay's Iranian subnet and refuses it - Tencent's games get
0.0.0.1, an address that leads nowhere. dnsmasq takes turns between its
upstreams, so with Google among them the refusal came and went, which is the
worst kind of fault to chase. 1.1.1.1 and 9.9.9.9 send no subnet.

epic-pin is the exception, on purpose: it asks for addresses that answer from
here, and the subnet helps it find them. It does not answer customers.
